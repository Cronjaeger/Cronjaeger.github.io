# Academic Profile

In 2014-2019 I was a DPhil Student at the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford (no thesis was ever handed in). I worked in statistical genetics; in particular my research concerned the development of inference algorithms for coalescent-based models (with computational complexity low enough that they would be practically useful for large datasets). I find it to be a fascinating area of research since it ties together ideas from stochastic processes, population genetics, combinatorics, computer science, and modern statistics. This research was in collaboration with (and supervised by) Professors Jotun Hein and Paul Jenkins.
