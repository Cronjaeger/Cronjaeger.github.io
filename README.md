# Passionate and extroverted nerd
I have studied Mathematics in Berlin and researched computational statistical genetics
in Oxford. Transitioning from academia to the corporate world, I joined Cisco as a
Networking Engineer where I worked for four years before taking a job at Novo Nordisk
doing IT infrastructure work on production critical Manufacturing Execution Systems.
Colleagues often appreciate working with me due to my natural curiosity and enthusiasm
for subjects that captivate me. This serves as a driving force behind my dedication and
ability to tackle challenges. I am currently seeking a role where I can use both the
analytical rigour from my academic background and the practical IT skills cultivated
working as in my Engineering roles.
One of my core strengths is conveying complex concepts through effective
communication and teaching, fostering a collaborative and engaging work environment.
Embracing my inner nerd, I find joy in diving deep into topics and geeking out.

My commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements is reflected in
my active engagement trends in Mathematics and AI/Machine Learning. I took the initiative to organize an after-work reading group, providing a platform for
participants to present and discuss
the latest AI methods when based in Amsterdam. See here for an example of what we
built while playing around (a simple model from scratch for detecting Cisco’s logo).
In summary, my journey from academic research to networking at Cisco highlights my
adaptability, passion for learning, and commitment to fostering collaborative inclusive
workspaces.

# Academic Profile
In 2014-2019 I was a DPhil Student at the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford (no thesis was ever handed in). I worked in statistical genetics; in particular my research concerned the development of inference algorithms for coalescent-based models (with computational complexity low enough that they would be practically useful for large datasets). I find it to be a fascinating area of research since it ties together ideas from stochastic processes, population genetics, combinatorics, computer science, and modern statistics. This research was in collaboration with (and supervised by) Professors Jotun Hein and Paul Jenkins.
